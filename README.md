# BackupScript

This script utilizes gdrive and fwbackups to upload my backup tarballs to Google Drive on Ubuntu.

## fwbackups
Begin by setting up [fwbackups](http://www.diffingo.com/oss/fwbackups) to output your backup as a tarball.

## gdrive
Next, install [gdrive](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive).

## Script
Then, download this script.

Change the directory to where your backup tarball is stored.

Change the name of the tarball to the name of your backup.

You're all set!
